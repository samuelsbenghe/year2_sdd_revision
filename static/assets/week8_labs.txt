Usability Testing Lab Worksheet
This worksheet will guide you through a usability testing lab focused on evaluating the form you designed and built for your coursework. We will explore
key usability concepts and apply practical testing methods to gather valuable
feedback and improve your form’s design.
Time: 2 hours

Section 1: Introduction to Usability (20 minutes)
Objectives:
• Understand the core principles of usability.
• Identify common usability issues in form design.
• Discuss the importance of user-centred design.
Activities:
1. Brainstorm: In groups, discuss what makes a website or application
“usable.” Consider factors like ease of use, eﬀiciency, memorability, errors,
and user satisfaction.
2. Case Study Analysis: Analyse examples of well-designed and poorly
designed forms. Look at examples from government digital services (e.g.,
GOV.UK) and commercial websites for comparison. Identify the key differences and their impact on usability.
3. Usability Principles Review: Review Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability
Heuristics (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
and discuss how they apply to form design.

Section 2: Planning Your Usability Test (20 minutes)
Objectives:
• Define clear objectives for your usability test.
• Identify your target user group and recruit participants.
• Develop realistic tasks for participants to perform.
• You will also want to think about things like informed consent, right to
withdraw, data retention policies etc.
Activities:
1. Define Objectives: What specific aspects of your form do you want to
test? (e.g., ease of understanding labels, eﬀiciency of completion, error
prevention)
2. Participant Recruitment: Determine who your target users are and
recruit 3-5 participants who represent that group. Consider your coursemates, friends, or family members who fit the user profile. If you need
to you can pop to the library or one of the other departments to recruit
users, but you can mostly work with other students in the lab.

3. Task Development: Create 3-5 specific tasks for participants to complete using your form (e.g., “Fill out the form with this information,” “Try
to submit the form with missing required fields”). Refer to your form’s
purpose and user needs when defining tasks. Hopefully the use (misuse)
of the form will tease out some issues. Try to break your colleague’s form
if you can.

Section 3: Conducting the Usability Test (40 minutes)
Objectives:
• Practise different usability testing methods (e.g., think-aloud protocol).
• Gather qualitative and quantitative data from participants.
• Observe and document user behaviour and feedback.
Activities:
1. Test Facilitation: One person acts as the facilitator, guiding the participant through the tasks and encouraging them to think aloud. Another
person acts as the observer, taking notes and recording any issues. For
this exercise you might want to have a go at both simultaneously as the
tasks are quite simple.
2. Think-Aloud Protocol: Encourage participants to verbalise their
thoughts and actions as they interact with the form. Prompt them with
questions like “What are you thinking now?” or “What do you expect to
happen?”
3. Data Collection: Record observations, task completion times, errors
made, and any comments from participants. Use a structured observation
sheet or a simple notebook to capture data. You can find lots of these
templates on the NNGroup site - https://www.nngroup.com/articles/freeux-templates/

Section 4: Analysing and Interpreting Results (30 minutes)
Objectives:
• Identify usability problems and their severity.
• Prioritise areas for improvement based on user feedback.
• Generate concrete recommendations for redesign.
Activities:
1. Data Synthesis: Compile all observations, notes, and recordings from
the usability tests. Look for patterns and common themes.
2. Issue Identification: Identify recurring patterns of user errors, confusion, or frustration.
3. Severity Rating: Rate the severity of each usability issue (e.g., low,
medium, high) based on its impact on user experience and frequency of
occurrence. I like to use a combination of ratings for both severity and
2

likelihood of occurrence. You can mix and match numbers with something
like a traﬀic light system for this.

Section 5: Reporting and Redesign (10 minutes)
Objectives:
• Communicate your findings in a clear and concise report.
• Translate user feedback into actionable design improvements.
Activities:
1. Report Writing (Word limit: 200 words): Briefly summarise your
usability testing process, key findings, and recommendations for improvement. Focus on the most critical usability issues and suggest specific
design changes. Throw the useful bits into comments in your coursework.
Remember: Usability testing is an iterative process. By repeating this cycle of
testing, analysis, and redesign, you can continuously improve the user experience
of your form.
