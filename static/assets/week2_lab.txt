Week 1 Lab Activities: Introduction to DRY, SOLID, Coupling, and Cohesion

Objective:
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

• Understand the DRY principle and how to avoid code repetition.
• Implement the SOLID principles in both JavaScript and Python.
• Analyse and reduce coupling between components.
• Increase cohesion within modules and functions.

Lab Activities Overview
1. Activity 1: DRY Principle

• Language: JavaScript
• Time: 30 minutes
• Goal: Demonstrate how to refactor code to remove repetition.

2. Activity 2: Implementing SOLID Principles

• Language: Python
• Time: 45 minutes
• Goal: Implement key SOLID principles (Single Responsibility Principle and 

Open/Closed Principle) in Python code.
3. Activity 3: Understanding Coupling and Cohesion

• Language: JavaScript
• Time: 30 minutes
• Goal: Refactor code to reduce coupling and increase cohesion.

4. Conclusion: A brief 15-minute Q&A and reflection session on what students learned.



Activity 1: DRY Principle in JavaScript

Overview:
Students will start by identifying repeated code in a JavaScript snippet and refactor it to make the 
code adhere to the DRY principle.

Steps:
1. Provide students with the following JavaScript code that has repetitions:

js
Copy code
function getAreaOfSquare(side) {
    return side * side;
}

function getAreaOfCircle(radius) {
    return 3.1416 * radius * radius;
}

function getAreaOfTriangle(base, height) {
    return 0.5 * base * height;
}

function getAreaOfRectangle(length, width) {
    return length * width;
}

2. Task: Refactor this code to remove repetition by using a single function that takes a shape 
and its dimensions as input and returns the area.

3. Discussion: After completing the refactoring, students should explain why the new version 
is more maintainable and adheres to the DRY principle.



Activity 2: Implementing SOLID Principles in Python

Overview:
This activity will focus on implementing the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and 
Open/Closed Principle (OCP) in Python.

Steps:
1. Poorly designed Python code:

python
Copy code
class Report:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def print_report(self):
        print("Report:")
        for item in self.data:
            print(f"Item: {item}")

    def save_to_file(self, filename):
        with open(filename, 'w') as file:
            for item in self.data:
                file.write(f"Item: {item}\n")

2. Task (SRP): Refactor the class Report to follow the Single Responsibility Principle, by 
separating the reporting logic from the saving logic.

3. Task (OCP): Modify the Report class to make it open for extension, but closed for 
modification. Introduce a new feature that allows reports to be saved in multiple formats 
(e.g., JSON, plain text) without modifying the original save_to_file method directly.

4. Discussion: After refactoring, students should explain how this design adheres to the 
Open/Closed Principle and is more flexible for future extensions.



Activity 3: Understanding Coupling and Cohesion in JavaScript

Overview:
Students will review a code sample that exhibits high coupling and low cohesion and will refactor it 
to reduce coupling and improve cohesion.

Steps:
1. Tghtly coupled JavaScript code:

js
Copy code
function displayUserProfile(user) {
    console.log(`Name: ${user.name}`);
    console.log(`Email: ${user.email}`);
    if (user.subscription === 'premium') {
        console.log('Premium user');
    } else {
        console.log('Standard user');
    }
}

function sendUserNotification(user) {
    if (user.subscription === 'premium') {
        console.log('Sending premium notification to', user.email);
    } else {
        console.log('Sending standard notification to', user.email);
    }
}

2. Task: Refactor this code to reduce coupling between the displayUserProfile and 
sendUserNotification functions. There are two things you need to do to complete 
this.

3. Discussion: Analyse why the new design improves modularity, reduces coupling, and 
increases cohesion between related functionalities.

Conclusion (15 minutes):
• Reflection & Q&A: Ask students to reflect on:

• How their refactored code adheres to DRY, SOLID, coupling, and cohesion 
principles.

• Real-world scenarios where these principles would be particularly important.
