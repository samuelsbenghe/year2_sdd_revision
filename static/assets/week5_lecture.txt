Introduction to User Testing
• User testing is a crucial process where actual users interact with a system or product to identify usability issues and pain points.

Importance of Early Usability
Testing
• Early CHI work stressed the value of usability testing before the design is finalized. It helps avoid costly changes later.

Nielsen's Law of User Experience
• Jakob Nielsen advocated for testing with small groups. 'You only need to test with 5 users to uncover 85% of usability issues.'


Iterative Testing
• Donald Norman stressed the need for iterative testing, with regular user feedback loops to refine products based on real-world interactions.




Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules
• Ben Shneiderman developed 8 design principles, which include 'Strive for consistency' and 'Seek universal usability.'





Thinking Aloud Protocol
• Nielsen popularized the 'think aloud' method where users verbalize their thoughts while using the system to identify usability challenges.

Donald Norman's Concept of
Affordances
• Affordances refer to the perceived properties of an object that suggest how it should be used. Testing ensures that these are clear to users.


Task-Based User Testing
• CHI pioneers emphasized testing based on real-world tasks that users would perform, to simulate actual usage scenarios.






Reducing Cognitive Load
• Shneiderman and others emphasized reducing cognitive load in interfaces through testing, ensuring users are not overwhelmed by complexity.



Nielsen's Heuristic Evaluation
• Jakob Nielsen proposed 10 usability heuristics that could be used alongside user testing to identify design flaws.


The Role of Feedback in Interfaces
• Don Norman stressed the importance of giving clear, immediate feedback to users, which user testing can help refine.

Consistency in User Interfaces
• Shneiderman's work highlighted the importance of consistency across interface elements, which user testing can help validate.






Error Prevention
• Testing can identify areas where users are prone to making errors. Early CHI literature highlights the importance of preventing errors through design.

A/B Testing
• A/B testing is a form of user testing where two versions of a design are compared to see which performs better with real users.







The User's Mental Model
• Don Norman's work showed that users build mental models of how systems should work. Testing helps ensure that the design aligns with those models.


Usability Metrics
• Early CHI research emphasized the importance of measuring usability with metrics like task completion rate and time-on-task.

Shneiderman's Direct Manipulation
Interfaces

• Shneiderman advocated for direct manipulation interfaces, which allow users to interact with objects on the screen directly. Testing ensures ease of use.

The Cost of Poor Usability
• Jakob Nielsen's studies showed that the cost of fixing a usability issue post-launch can be up to 100 times more than if it were caught during testing.


Simplicity vs. Complexity
• Norman's work argued that while simplicity is desirable, it's more important to design interfaces that are understandable, which is validated through testing.
• He has a great book on this topic - Living with Complexity.

Usability Testing in Agile
• Agile methodologies encourage frequent iterations, and user testing is key to ensuring each version of the product is moving towards better usability.

Remote User Testing
• With the advent of remote tools, user testing can now be conducted anywhere, providing a broader and more diverse set of feedback.

The Role of User Personas
• Creating user personas can guide user testing by representing real-world user groups and ensuring that their needs are met.

Cultural Considerations in Testing
• Testing with users from different cultural backgrounds can reveal usability issues that might not be apparent with a homogenous testing group.

The Importance of Real-World
Contexts
• Testing in real-world environments can uncover usability issues that controlled lab testing might miss.

Early CHI and Usability Engineering
• CHI pioneers like Nielsen and Norman laid the foundation for modern usability engineering practices through rigorous user testing.
• This is empirical, largely quantitative and what we call a 'discount' technique.

Field Studies in CHI
• Field studies allow researchers to observe users in their natural environments, providing insights into usability challenges that structured lab testing may miss.

User Experience vs. Usability
• While usability focuses on how easy a product is to use, early CHI literature also highlights the importance of overall user experience.

Identifying Pain Points
• Through user testing, pain points or areas where users struggle are identified and addressed before the product goes to market.
• You will have to mix and match to get good value.

Prototyping and Testing
• Prototypes allow designers to test concepts before full development. Early CHI pioneers advocated for testing as early as possible.

The Role of Surveys in Testing
• In addition to observing behavior, surveys can provide direct user feedback on specific aspects of the interface.

The Concept of Learnability
• Nielsen stressed the importance of learnability-how quickly a user can become proficient in using a new system.
• Also memorability, in coming back to the system and 'remembering' how to use it.

Paper Prototyping
• Before digital tools, early CHI researchers often used paper prototypes for testing designs cheaply and effectively.
• They are still useful! Bill Buxton has a book on the topic.

The Role of Accessibility
• User testing is crucial for identifying accessibility issues and ensuring that products are usable by people with varying abilities.

Testing for Error Recovery
• User testing helps ensure that when users make errors, the system provides them with clear, easy-to-follow recovery options.

Testing Mobile Usability
• Mobile devices introduced new usability challenges, and CHI researchers were among the first to highlight the importance of mobile user testing.
• My PhD supervisor Professor Steve Love wrote some books on this topic.

The Importance of Documentation
• User testing can also highlight gaps in user documentation, helping to improve onboarding and learning materials.
• We can mix and match with TDD to get value.

Cognitive Walkthroughs
• A cognitive walkthrough involves stepping through the interface as a user would, predicting usability challenges before testing.

Multimodal Interfaces
• CHI research also explored the usability of multimodal interfaces, where users interact via touch, voice, and other inputs.
• Lots of mathematical models such as Fitts' Law provide empirical evidence to support these mechanisms being loosely similar and quantifiable.

Performance Metrics
• Through user testing, performance metrics like task efficiency and error rates can be measured to evaluate the design's effectiveness.

Testing for Satisfaction
• User testing should not only focus on efficiency but also on whether the user enjoys the interaction and finds it satisfying.

Visual Hierarchy in UI
• Testing helps determine whether the visual hierarchy of a design is clear, guiding users through tasks efficiently.

Simplicity in Interaction Design
• Shneiderman emphasized the importance of keeping interactions simple, which user testing can validate.
• Essentially one click is better than four!

Test Early, Test Often
• One of Jakob Nielsen's principles is to test early and test often. User feedback is critical at all stages of design.

Heuristic Evaluations vs. User
Testing
• Nielsen recommended using both heuristic evaluations and user testing for comprehensive usability insights.

Testing with Diverse User Groups
• Early CHI work emphasized the importance of testing with a wide range of users to ensure the system is usable by as many people as possible.
