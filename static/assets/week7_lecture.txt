Introduction to Robust and Secure
Programming
• Robust and secure programming is the
foundation of reliable software systems.

Introduction to Robust and Secure
Programming (Continued)
• Cybercrime damages are expected to reach
$10.5 trillion annually by 2025.

Software Development Best
Practices
• Adopting best practices ensures
maintainability and security in software.

Software Development Best
Practices (Continued)
• 'Code is like humor. When you have to explain
it, it’s bad.' – Cory House

Input Validation and Output
Encoding
• Sanitizing inputs prevents a majority of
injection attacks.

Input Validation and Output
Encoding
if (empty($_POST["name"])) {
$errors['name'] = "Name is required.";
} else {
$name = filter_var(trim($_POST["name"]),
FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
if (!preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z ]*$/", $name)) {
$errors['name'] = "Only letters and white spaces
are allowed in the name.";
}
}

Input Validation and Output
Encoding

PHP has a bad reputation, but is actually very good at
solving this type of problem, using native tools.
A mix of built in methods (filter validate email according to
RFC 5321 and RFC 5322) that basically acts like regex +
some removal of whitespace (new strings, tabbing etc etc.)

the top security risks.

Secure Memory Management
• Memory safety errors account for 70% of all
vulnerabilities in critical systems.

Secure Memory Management
(Continued)
• Tools like Valgrind and AddressSanitizer can
identify memory-related issues.

Authentication and Authorization
• Authentication ensures only legitimate users
can access the system.

Authentication and Authorization
(Continued)
• Multi-factor authentication blocks 99.9% of
account compromise attacks.

Data Protection
• Encryption and hashing protect sensitive data
from unauthorized access.

Data Protection (Continued)
• AES encryption is used by over 70% of secure
applications worldwide.

AES
Imagine a super-secret blender!
• The Key: This is like your secret password, only way more
complicated. It's a long string of numbers that only you and
your friend know.
• Locking the Data: You put your milkshake recipe into the
blender. AES chops it up then uses your secret password to
whiz it all around, mixing and scrambling it until it looks like
crumbs.
• Unlocking the Data: Your friend has the same blender and the
same secret password. They put the crumbs in, type in the
password, and the blender magically turns the milkshake back
to fruit!

AES
• Why is it so secure?
• The configuration makes it an infeasible
scenario to bruteforce. You would have to try
all manner of combinations of berries, milk etc
to crack
the recipe!

Concurrency and Multithreading
• Securely managing threads avoids race
conditions and data corruption.

Concurrency and Multithreading
(Continued)
• Deadlocks and race conditions cost
organisations millions in downtime.

Concurrency and Multithreading
(Continued)
Deadlock
• Imagine two friends, each holding a different
toy the other wants. They both refuse to give
up their toy until they get the other's,
resulting in a standstill where neither can play.
They're stuck!

Concurrency and Multithreading
(Continued)
Race Condition
• Two siblings race to grab the last cookie from
the jar. Whoever reaches it first gets to eat it,
but it's unpredictable who will win. The
outcome of the "race" determines who gets
the cookie.

Secure Software Design Patterns
• Secure design principles proactively mitigate
vulnerabilities.

Secure Software Design Patterns
(Continued)
• 'Design is not just what it looks like and feels
like. Design is how it works.' – Steve Jobs

Secure Deployment and
Configuration
• A secure deployment ensures no sensitive
data leaks into production.
• The reading task for this week covers some
best practice to avoid cybersecurity issues.

Secure Deployment and
Configuration (Continued)
• Misconfigurations are a leading cause of cloud
breaches.
• Leaking secure keys, obscurities in the config
etc can all cause issues.
• This is why tools like Docker are becoming
more popular. Container-based systems take a
‘snapshot’ of a system and deploy it as is.

Vulnerability Assessment and
Mitigation
• Vulnerability assessments help identify weak
points in software.

Vulnerability Assessment and
Mitigation (Continued)
• 'Fixing a vulnerability in development costs 6
times less than in production.'

Compliance and Regulatory
Considerations
• Security standards ensure compliance and
trust in sensitive domains.

Compliance and Regulatory
Considerations (Continued)
• GDPR fines totaled $1.2 billion in 2022,
highlighting the cost of non-compliance.

Emerging Trends and Advanced
