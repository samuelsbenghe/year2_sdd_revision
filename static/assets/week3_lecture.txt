Introduction to Software Testing
• Software testing ensures that software 

functions correctly and meets specified 
requirements.



Types of Software Testing
• Unit testing, integration testing, system 

testing, and acceptance testing are common 
types.



Unit Testing
• Tests individual components of the software 

to ensure they work in isolation.



Integration Testing
• Ensures that different modules or services 

work together as expected.



System Testing
• Verifies that the complete software system 

meets the specified requirements.



Acceptance Testing
• Ensures the software meets the business 

needs and is ready for release.



Static Testing
• Involves reviewing documents and code 

without executing the software.



Dynamic Testing
• Involves executing code and checking the 

output for expected results.



White Box Testing
• The tester has knowledge of the internal code 

and tests the logic directly.



Black Box Testing
• Tests functionality without knowing the 

internal workings of the software.



Automated Testing
• Uses software tools to run tests automatically, 

improving efficiency.



Manual Testing
• Human testers manually execute tests and 

review the results.



Test Cases
• Test cases define the inputs, execution 

conditions, and expected results for a test.



Test Plans
• A test plan outlines the testing strategy, scope, 

and resources needed for testing.



Test Scripts
• A set of instructions that are executed during 

testing, especially in automated tests.



Test Data
• Data used during testing to check the system's 

behavior under various conditions.



Regression Testing
• Ensures that new code changes do not break 

existing functionality.



Performance Testing
• Tests how the system performs under high 

load or stress conditions.



Load Testing
• Measures the system's ability to handle 

expected user loads.



Stress Testing
• Puts the system under extreme conditions to 

test its limits.



Usability Testing
• Ensures the software is user-friendly and 

meets the needs of its users.



Security Testing
• Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures that the 

system is secure against attacks.



Alpha Testing
• Conducted by internal developers or testers 

before the software is released.



Beta Testing
• Performed by end users in a real-world 

environment to catch issues before the final 
release.



Test Metrics
• Metrics like pass/fail rates help measure the 

effectiveness of testing.



Test Automation Tools
• Popular tools include Selenium, JUnit, and 

Jenkins for automating the testing process.



Bug Tracking
• Tracking and managing bugs is critical to fixing 

defects in a timely manner.



Review Techniques
• Reviews help identify errors early and improve 

software quality.



Continuous Integration & Testing
• Automating the integration and testing of 

code helps detect issues early.



Conclusion: Importance of Testing
• Software testing is vital to delivering a high-

quality product.
