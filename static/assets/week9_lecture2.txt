Deeper Understanding of SRP
• A class should have only one reason to
change.
• Example: Logger and OrderProcessor
responsibilities remain separate.

Applying OCP
• Design for extension without modifying
existing code.
• Example: Add new shapes to a drawing app
without altering existing code.

LSP in Practice
• Derived classes substitute their parents
without altering behavior.
• Example: Vehicles like Cars and Bicycles share
the same interface.

ISP: Simplifying Interfaces
• Break large interfaces into smaller, more
specific ones.
• Example: Separate Printable and Scannable
functionalities for devices.

DIP: Flexible Dependencies
• Depend on abstractions rather than
concretions.
• Example: PaymentService relies on a
PaymentProcessor interface.

What are Anti-Patterns?
• Recurring solutions that often cause more
problems than they solve.
• Example: God Object, Spaghetti Code.

The God Object Problem
• A class that knows too much or does too
much.
• Solution: Refactor into smaller, focused
classes.

Spaghetti Code
• Unstructured and difficult-to-read code.
• Solution: Modularize and use clear control
flows.

Benefits of Modularization
• Improves readability, testing, and
maintainability.
• Example: Splitting billing, inventory, and user
management into modules.

Cohesion in Design
• Cohesion measures how related the
functionalities of a module are.
• High cohesion ensures modules do one thing
well.

What is Refactoring?
• Improving the structure of code without
changing its behavior.
• Stat: 70% of developers refactor to reduce
bugs (Fowler, 2018).

Examples of Refactoring
• Rename variables for clarity.
• Extract methods to remove duplication.
• Example, we have one calculate area function.
We define a class for each type of shape
(rectangle, circle) and embed logic therein.
• Easier to maintain, don’t have to remember
logic of ‘how to for…’

Reducing Redundancy in Code
• Use functions and templates for repetitive
tasks.
• Example: Parameterize queries in database
code.

Reducing Redundancy in Code
user_id = 123
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id};"

• Not great. Let’s improve.
username = "johndoe"
email = "johndoe@example.com"
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND
email = ?;"

DRY Across Teams
• Standardize tools and practices to avoid
redundancy.
• Example: Shared libraries for common utilities.
