Final Lecture: Advanced Software
Design and Development

Introduction
• Wrapping up key topics and introducing
advanced tools for robust software
development.

Learning Objectives
• 1. Strengthen programming skills.
• 2. Write robust, maintainable, and secure
code.
• 3. Collaborate effectively using version
control.
• 4. Test-driven development.

1. Defensive Coding
• Importance of writing code that anticipates
and handles invalid inputs and errors.

Exception Handling
• Use try-except blocks to gracefully handle
unforeseen runtime errors.

Static Code Analysis
• Tools like SonarQube and PyLint help detect
bugs and code smells early.

Static Code Analysis
• Tools like SonarQube and PyLint help detect
bugs and code smells early.

Design by Contract
• Define preconditions, postconditions, and
invariants to ensure code correctness.

Preconditions

postconditions
• Define preconditions, postconditions, and
invariants to ensure code correctness.

2. Modular Design
• Principles of high cohesion and low coupling
for scalable systems.

Cohesion
• Modules should be organised around a single,
well-defined purpose.

Coupling
• Minimise dependencies between modules to
simplify testing and maintenance.

3. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
• Write tests before implementing functionality
to ensure requirements are met.

Unit Tests
• Isolate and test small parts of the codebase
using frameworks like PyTest.

Integration Tests
• Ensure that modules interact correctly using
tools like Selenium.

Code Coverage
• Measure test coverage with tools like
Coverage.py.

4. User Testing
• Involve users early and often to identify
usability issues.

Usability Testing
• Evaluate user interactions to improve interface
design.

Accessibility Testing
• Ensure the software is usable by people with
disabilities.

5. Version Control Best Practices
• Use Git effectively for individual and
collaborative projects.

6. API Design and Interaction
• Use APIs to communicate between systems.

cURL Basics
• Send HTTP requests and handle responses
from APIs.

Postman and Insomnia
• Test and debug APIs using GUI tools.

Continuous Integration
• Merge code frequently and test changes
automatically.

Continuous Deployment
• Deploy tested code to production
automatically.

8. Profiling and Performance
• Identify bottlenecks and optimise code
performance.

Command-line Tools
• Use `htop`, `perf`, and `ab` to monitor and
benchmark systems. Chrome extensions also
support profiling.

Error Handling Strategies
• Graceful degradation, retries, and fallback
mechanisms.

Scalability Awareness
• Consider the impact of module design on
scalability.

Real-World Practices
• Peer code reviews improve code quality and
team collaboration.

Code Reviews
• Use GitHub or GitLab to conduct effective
peer reviews.
• When you write a new bit of code you have to
explain it to the team.
• One person ‘chairs’ the code review, takes
notes, actions.
• One or more person assigned to critique, but
others can also ask questions for clarity.

Documentation
• Document code clearly.
• Unit tests document functionality (or at least
perceived expectations.)
• Comments are your friend e.g. docstrings.

Documentation

Future-Proofing Code
• Refactor to manage technical debt and
maintain code quality.

Introduction to DevOps
• Learn about DevOps culture and tools for
collaboration.

Final Thoughts
• Most people don’t know what they’re doing.
• Criticality of self is vital.
• Empirical testing will get you 80% of the way
there.
• Some of this stuff is still subjective (e.g. too
much code coverage for your tests is generally
not desirable.)

Final Thoughts
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (Philosopher and
Writer):
“Perfection is achieved, not when there is
nothing more to add, but when there is
nothing left to take away.”

Final Thoughts
Aristotle (Greek Philosopher):
“The whole is greater than the sum of its
parts.”

Final Thoughts
Confucius (Chinese Philosopher):
“Success depends upon previous preparation,
and without such preparation, there is sure to
be failure.”

Final Thoughts
Voltaire (French Philosopher):
“The best is the enemy of the good.”

Final Thoughts
You are just getting started on what could be a
very exciting journey.

Thank You!

• Exams in January.
• I’ll see you all again (soon) for Computing
Project II...
