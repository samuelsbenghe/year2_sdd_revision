Section B: Open-Ended Questions (60 marks - answer 2 out of 3)
Question 1: Module Coupling and Cohesion (30 marks)
a) Explain the concepts of module coupling and cohesion. Provide examples of high and low
coupling and cohesion. (10 marks)
b) Discuss the benefits of high cohesion and low coupling in software design. (10 marks)
c) You are designing a system for an online store. Identify three modules and explain how you
would ensure low coupling and high cohesion between them. (10 marks)

Question 2: Defensive Coding and User Testing (30 marks)
a) Explain the importance of defensive coding in software development. Provide three examples of
defensive coding techniques. (10 marks)
b) Describe the different stages involved in user testing. How can the results of user testing be used
to improve software design? (10 marks)
c) A function calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart. Write this function in a language
of your choice (JavaScript, Python, Pseudocode, or Flowchart) demonstrating defensive coding
techniques to handle potential invalid inputs (e.g., negative quantity, invalid price). (10 marks)

Question 3: Version Control and Test-Driven Development (30 marks)
a) Explain the benefits of using version control systems like Git. Describe the key concepts of
branching, merging, and committing in Git. (10 marks)
b) Outline the process of test-driven development (TDD). Discuss the advantages of using TDD in
software development. (10 marks)
c) You are developing a function to validate a user's email address. Describe the steps you would
take to develop this function using a TDD approach. You may use Javascript, Python, Pseudocode
or a Flowchart to illustrate your tests and code. (10 marks)
