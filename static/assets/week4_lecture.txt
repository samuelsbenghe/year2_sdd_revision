Acceptance Testing in Agile

• Verifies software meets business 
requirements and is ready for release.



Acceptance Testing in Agile

“80% of teams in Agile use acceptance tests to 
align software with business needs.” - Agile 
Testing Survey



Role of Acceptance Testing

• Acceptance tests define the 'Definition of 
Done' (DoD) in Agile projects.



Anatomy of Acceptance Testing
Social Media:

Scenario: User creates a new account, uploads a profile picture, and adds friends. 

Expected Result: The profile is successfully created and visible to others.

Scenario: User posts a message with an image and tags other users. 

Expected Result: The post appears in the user's feed and the feeds of tagged users.

Scenario: User sends a private message to another user. 

Expected Result: The message is delivered to the recipient's inbox.



Role in Agile

“Agile teams using Acceptance Test-Driven 
Development (ATDD) reduce production bugs by 
30%.”

ATDD & Three Amigos

• ATDD encourages collaboration between 
developers, testers, and business 
stakeholders.

ATDD & Three Amigos



ATDD

The 'Three Amigos' model clarifies requirements 
before development begins.



ATDD
Acceptance Criteria:

The system should clearly display the classification (e.g., First Class, 2:1, 2:2, 
Third Class) for each module.

The system should provide a clear explanation of the grade boundaries for 
each classification.

The system should calculate and display a projected final degree 
classification based on current grades.

The system should allow me to input predicted grades for future modules to 
see how they might affect my final classification.

The system should be accessible on multiple devices (e.g., desktop, mobile).



ATDD
Scenario: Student with 70% average across all modules 

Expected Result: System displays "First Class" classification.

Scenario: Student with 65% average, but with a failed module 

Expected Result: System displays a warning about the failed module and its 
potential impact on the final classification.

Scenario: Student inputs predicted grades of 60% for remaining modules 

Expected Result: System accurately calculates and displays the projected 
final degree classification based on current and predicted grades.



ATDD

We can confirm ATDD scenario by checking to 
see it validates against our ‘user stories’ or ‘use 
cases.’

We can even automate this process.

What’s the most common browser resolution(s)?



ATDD
Do our research. Source: StatCounter and BrowserStack

1920x1080: This is the most popular resolution by a significant margin. It's 
the standard for many modern monitors and laptops, offering a good 
balance of screen space and sharpness.

360x800(mobile first): This resolution is very common on mobile devices, 
especially in the Android ecosystem. It reflects the shift towards taller, 
narrower screens on smartphones.  

1366x768: This was once extremely popular for laptops and some smaller 
monitors. While it's less common on newer devices, it still holds a significant 
share due to the large number of devices with this resolution still in use.

Now what?

Selenium for Automated Testing

• Selenium automates web browser interactions 
to conduct end-to-end tests.



Selenium Use

“75% of web automation frameworks rely on 
Selenium for testing workflows and user 
interfaces.”



Selenium in Acceptance Testing

• Automates acceptance tests to verify 
workflows such as login, navigation, and 
transactions.



Selenium in CI Pipelines

• Selenium tests can be integrated into 
Continuous Integration pipelines to provide 
quick feedback on code changes.



Selenium in CI Pipelines



Selenium in CI

“Using Selenium in CI pipelines reduces testing 
time by 40%.”



W3C Validator

• The W3C Validator checks HTML and CSS code 
for compliance with web standards, improving 
cross-browser compatibility.



W3C Validator Use

Validating code reduces cross-browser issues and 
improves accessibility by 20%.



Lighthouse for Web Testing

• Lighthouse is an open-source tool that 
assesses web performance, accessibility, SEO, 
and best practices.



Lighthouse Impact
“Websites with high Lighthouse scores rank 30% 
better in Google search results.”

Google will go as far as to not index your site if 
you do not follow best practice!



Other Testing Tools

• Tools like Pa11y and Axe help automate 
accessibility checks to ensure compliance with 
web accessibility standards.



Accessibility Tools

“Axe-core is used by over 60% of accessibility 
testers worldwide.”

https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core



Continuous Integration & Testing

• CI integrates code changes frequently and 
runs automated tests to ensure quality in each 
iteration.



CI & Testing Impact

“Automating tests in CI pipelines can reduce 
deployment times by 50%.”



Integrating Testing Tools

• Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and other CI tools 
allow the automation of tests like Selenium, 
W3C Validator, and Lighthouse.



CI Tooling

70% of high-performing teams integrate 
automated tests into their CI pipelines.



Performance & Load Testing

• Tests how the application performs under 
heavy load and stress to ensure it can handle 
real-world traffic.



Performance Testing Example

Example: Stress testing an app with over 1,000 
concurrent users to ensure stability. You could 
also look at time to execute e.g.



Gatling for Load Testing

• Gatling is an open-source load and 
performance testing tool that helps identify 
bottlenecks.



Gatling Impact

“Using Gatling improves app scalability by 25% 
by detecting bottlenecks early.”



Gatling Impact



Security Testing

• Tools like OWASP ZAP automate security 
testing, helping detect vulnerabilities in web 
applications.

https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy



Security Impact

“98% of websites that pass OWASP ZAP security 
checks avoid common vulnerabilities.”

Most penetration testers will focus heavily on the 
“low hanging fruit.” Generally safe is, for the 
most, part safe.



Usability & Accessibility Testing

• Usability and accessibility tests ensure that applications 
are user-friendly and meet accessibility standards.



Accessibility Impact

Accessible websites see a 25% increase in user 
engagement due to inclusive design.
