Introduction to Usability
• Understanding the ease of use and
effectiveness of a system.

Importance of Usability
• Usability impacts user satisfaction,
productivity, and error rates.

Heuristic Evaluation
• A method to identify usability problems using
usability principles (Nielsen, 1994).

Usability Heuristics
• Common principles: visibility, consistency,
error prevention, and more.

Cognitive Walkthroughs
• Evaluating task flow based on user goals and
system feedback.

Steps in Cognitive Walkthrough
• Define tasks, identify goals, analyze actions
(Wharton et al., 1994).

Think Aloud Studies
• Users verbalize thoughts while interacting
with a system.

Benefits of Think Aloud
• Provides insights into user decision-making
processes.

Usability Metrics
• Objective measures: task completion rate,
error rate, and time on task.

Task Completion Rate
• Percentage of users who successfully
complete a task. Aim for >85%.

Error Rate
• Tracks errors made during interaction. Lower
is better (e.g., 5%).

Time on Task
• Measures efficiency by recording time needed
to complete tasks.

System Usability Scale (SUS)
• A standardized survey to evaluate usability
(Brooke, 1996).

SUS Scoring
• Scores >68 indicate above-average usability.

Eye-Tracking Studies
• Analyze user focus and navigation patterns
(e.g., heatmaps).

A/B Testing
• Comparing two versions of a system to
determine which performs better.

Advantages of A/B Testing
• Provides quantitative data on user
preferences.

Controlled Experiments
• Studies that test usability changes under
controlled conditions.

Remote Usability Testing
• Allows users to test systems from their own
environment.

Qualitative Feedback
• Insights gained from user interviews and
open-ended questions.

Quantitative Metrics
• Objective measures like error rates and task
efficiency.

Net Promoter Score (NPS)
• Measures user loyalty based on likelihood to
recommend.

User Satisfaction Surveys
• Gather subjective user feedback on system
performance.

Task Analysis
• Breaks down tasks to understand user goals
and difficulties.

User Journey Mapping
• Visual representation of user interactions over
time.

Accessibility Testing
• Ensures usability for users with disabilities
(e.g., WCAG standards).

Mobile Usability
• Special considerations for usability on mobile
devices.

Responsive Design
• Adapts layout and functionality to different
screen sizes.

Error Recovery
• Designing for smooth recovery from errors.

Feedback Loops
• Providing users with immediate and clear
system feedback.

Progress Indicators
• Show users their progress in multi-step tasks.

Consistency in Design
• Ensures uniformity in navigation and
interaction patterns.

Minimizing Cognitive Load
• Reduces mental effort needed to use a
system.

Engagement Metrics
• Measures how users interact and stay engaged
with a system.

Iterative Design
• Improves usability through repeated cycles of
testing and refinement.

Persona Development
• Creating user personas to guide design
decisions.

Scenario Testing
• Evaluating usability through real-world user
scenarios.

Information Architecture
• Structuring content and navigation for optimal
usability.

Card Sorting
• Understanding how users categorize and label
information.

Heatmaps
• Visual representations of user interaction
patterns.

Error Messages
• Designing clear and actionable error
messages.

Contextual Inquiry
• Observing users in their natural environment
to gather insights.

Competitive Usability Analysis
• Benchmarking usability against competitors.

Load Time Metrics
• Assessing how quickly pages and features
load.

Microinteractions
• Small design details that enhance user
experience.

User Onboarding
• Strategies to help users quickly adapt to a
system.

Gamification
• Using game-like elements to increase
engagement.

Emotional Design
• Creating designs that evoke positive emotions.

Future Trends in Usability
• Exploring innovations like AI and VR in
usability testing.

Cross-Cultural Usability
• Designing for a global and diverse audience.

Simplicity in Design
• Emphasizing clarity and ease of use.

User Advocacy
• Ensuring that user needs remain the focus of
design decisions.

Summary and Conclusion
• Purpose of testing with users?
• When should we test with users?
• How would you plan an in person study?
• Considerations around remote usability
testing?
