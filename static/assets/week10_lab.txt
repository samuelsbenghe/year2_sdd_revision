SECTION B (Written questions, this section contains three questions, each
worth 30 marks. You must select and answer ONLY TWO of them.)
Question 2: Secure Deployment and Memory Management (30 marks)
a. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: The "SolarWinds Hack" and "Log4j Vulnerability"
highlighted major risks in modern software development. i. Explain what a Supply Chain
Attack is. Why is securing third-party dependencies often more difficult than securing your
own code? ii. Describe one lesson learned from the Equifax Data Breach regarding patch
management. [10 marks]
b. Memory Safety: In languages like C++, memory management is manual. i. Explain the
concept of a Memory Leak. How does it occur and what is the long-term impact on a
running server? ii. Name one tool mentioned in the lecture material that can help identify
memory safety errors. [5 marks]
c. Secure Configuration & Containers: Misconfigurations are a leading cause of cloud
breaches. i. Explain why Containerization (using tools like Docker) is preferred over
manual deployment for ensuring security and consistency across different environments. ii.
Referencing the Capital One breach, explain the danger of a misconfigured firewall or
excessive access privileges. [5 marks]
d. Encryption: i. Describe AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) using the "Secret
Blender" analogy. Why is the configuration of AES considered secure against brute-force
attacks? ii. Explain the difference between Authentication and Authorization. [10 marks]
Question 3: Usability Engineering and User Research (30 marks)
a. Information Architecture: i. Describe the Card Sorting method (Closed vs. Open).
How does this specific activity help designers create intuitive navigation structures (menus)?
ii. Contrast this with User Journey Mapping. What different aspect of the user experience
does a Journey Map visualize compared to a Card Sort? [10 marks]
b. Profiling and Performance: i. Define Eye-Tracking Studies and Heatmaps. How can
these visual tools reveal flaws in a UI's visual hierarchy that a standard survey might miss? ii.
Explain the significance of the System Usability Scale (SUS). What score is generally
considered the threshold for "above average" usability? [10 marks]
c. Accessibility (Inclusive Design): i. Explain the concept of Perceivable information under
WCAG guidelines. Give an example of how "Alt Text" for images satisfies this principle. ii.
Beyond legal compliance, explain the business argument for Accessibility. How does it
affect the potential market size and user engagement? [10 marks]
Question 4: Design Principles and Git Internals (30 marks)
a. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): i. Analyze the following scenario: A developer copies a
SQL query string into five different functions, changing only the ID variable in each. Identify
the maintenance risk if the database schema changes (e.g., a column is renamed). ii. Propose
a specific refactoring technique (e.g., using a Template or centralized function) to resolve this
redundancy. [5 marks]

b. Coupling and Cohesion: i. Define Content Coupling. Why is this considered the
"worst" form of coupling compared to Data Coupling? ii. Explain the relationship between
High Cohesion and Modular Design. Why should a module be organized around a "single,
well-defined purpose"? [10 marks]
c. Git Internals: i. Explain the purpose of the Staging Area (Index) in Git. Why does Git
require a two-step process (git add then git commit) rather than just saving the file state
directly? ii. Describe the function of the .gitignore file. Why is it critical for both
repository cleanliness and security (e.g., avoiding the commit of API keys)? [5 marks]
d. Code Reviews: i. Beyond simply finding bugs, explain two "soft" benefits of conducting
Peer Code Reviews for the development team (e.g., knowledge sharing). ii. What is the role
of a Checklist in a code review? Name one item that should be on a standard code review
checklist regarding Readability or Security. [10 marks]
