Software Design and
Development
Comprehensive Revision Lecture: Key
Concepts and Practical Applications

Introduction to Software Design
• Software design ensures maintainability and
scalability.
• Key goals: simplicity, clarity, and adaptability
(McGrath et al., 2013).

Importance of Design Principles
• Guides development to reduce technical debt
(Beck, 2003).
• Ensures robustness and quality in software.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
• Each class or module has one responsibility.
• Analogy: A chef doesn’t also clean the dining
area.

Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
• Modules should be extendable without
modification.
• Analogy: Adding a new feature to a phone
without altering its existing hardware.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
• Derived classes should work as substitutes for
base classes.
• Analogy: Electric cars can replace fuel cars in a
garage.

Interface Segregation Principle
(ISP)
• Avoid forcing classes to implement unused
interfaces.
• Analogy: A universal remote doesn’t need all
buttons for every device.

Dependency Inversion Principle
(DIP)
• High-level modules depend on abstractions,
not details.
• Analogy: Using an adapter to plug devices into
different outlets.

Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)
• Avoid redundancy to improve maintainability.
• Stat: 60% of bugs stem from repetitive code
(Larman, 2004).

Applying DRY in Projects
• Centralize logic in functions or modules.
• Use templates for repeated structures.

Modularization
• Break systems into independent, cohesive
modules.
• Example: Separate billing, inventory, and user
management.

Encapsulation
• Restrict access to internal module details.
• Example: Using private methods in classes.

Abstraction
• Simplify complex details behind simple
interfaces.
• Example: A `print()` function abstracts printer
drivers.

Version Control
• Git tracks changes and enables collaboration.
• Stat: 99% of developers use version control
(Chacon & Straub, 2014).

Unit Testing
• Test individual components in isolation.
• Stat: Teams with automated tests deploy 40%
faster (Beck, 2003).

Continuous Integration (CI)
• Automate testing with each code change.
• Stat: CI reduces deployment errors by 30%.

Secure Software Design
• Incorporate security at every development
stage.
• Stat: 70% of breaches result from poor design
(OWASP, 2023).

Emerging Trends
• AI in bug detection and prevention.
• Stat: AI reduces time-to-detection by 50%.

Recap of Key Principles
• SOLID: Core design principles for maintainable
code.
• DRY: Avoid redundancy for clarity and
efficiency.

Q&A
• Open floor for questions.
• Discuss real-world applications of principles.
